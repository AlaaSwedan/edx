out some stats about webpack compilation process to a file.\n\n<br>\n\n#### Install\n\n```bash\nnpm install --save-dev webpack-bundle-tracker\n```\n\n<br>\n\n#### Usage\n```javascript\nvar BundleTracker  = require('webpack-bundle-tracker');\nmodule.exports = {\n        context: __dirname,\n    entry: {\n      app: ['./app']\n    },\n    \n    output: {\n        path:

BundleTracker({path: __dirname, filename: './assets/webpack-stats.json'})\n    ]\n}\n```\n\n`./assets/webpack-stats.json` will look like,\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\":\"done\",\n  \"chunks\":{\n

\"path\":\"/home/user/project-root/assets/bundles/app-0828904584990b611fb8.js\"\n    }]\n  }\n}\n```\n\nIn case webpack is still compiling, it'll look like,\n\n\n```json\n{\n  \"status\":\"compiling\",\n}\n```\n\n\n\nAnd errors will look like,\n```json\n{\n  \"status\": \"error\",\n  \"file\": \"/path/to/file/that/caused/the/error\",\n  \"error\": \"ErrorName\", \n  \"message\": \"ErrorMessage\"\n}\n```\n\n`ErrorMessage` shows the line and column that caused the error.\n\n\n\nAnd in case `logTime` option is set to `true`, the output will look like,\n```\n{\n  \"status\":\"done\",\n  \"chunks\":{\n   \"app\":[{\n      \"name\":\"app-0828904584990b611fb8.js\",\n      \"publicPath\":\"http://localhost:3000/assets/bundles/app-0828904584990b611fb8.js\",\n

will not be indented. To increase readability, you can use the `indent`\noption to make the output legible. By default it is off. The value that is set here will be directly\npassed to the `space` parameter in `JSON.stringify`.
